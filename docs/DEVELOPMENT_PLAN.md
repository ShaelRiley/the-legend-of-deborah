# Current development plan

`main` is the canonical development baseline. Shael explicitly approved candidate
`87920e5ba3b27d46ff096f5a85cd41030a77f964` for promotion on 2026-09-14;
that exact commit was fast-forwarded to remote `main` without code changes.

Astra / Work is the primary implementation and senior-engineering environment.
Sol complements it with architecture, review, planning, and bounded implementation
where useful. Antigravity and `hybrid/antigravity` are retired as active development
workers/workflows. See [Development workflow](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md).

## Current checkpoint — Soldier crash investigation and wallet repair

The 2026-09-15 playtest force-closed. The full log records a successful Raw Bolt
hit followed by a lethal AR2 hit on the same Soldier; it ends before death/XP
completion. The native fault is not established. Repair the independently
reproduced wallet SQL-quoting defect, defer native corpse mutations out of the
death callback, guard duplicate kill settlement and add bounded death-stage
diagnostics. All 76 integrated automated suites pass. Source crash resolution
remains pending: repeat only Bolt → AR2 Soldier kill on a fresh application start.
See [evidence, repair and finite gate](CRASH_REPAIR_2026_09_15.md). No main
promotion or deployment; retain the combined candidate's feature scope.

## Previous checkpoint — Equipment tab, filled Magic areas and rear statue

The author's follow-up presentation direction is implemented on the same combined
`astra/equipment-update` candidate under live GDD LOD-UI-009. Equipment is now a
first-class sibling tab with its own frame; Magic areas have solid outer boundaries
and approximately 40%-opaque interiors; the Deborah statue is behind the Hermit
and uses the portal/manual prompt style. The author's subsequent correction
explicitly retains the existing face HUD position. All 75 integrated automated
suites pass; Source visual acceptance is pending. See
[presentation checkpoint](PRESENTATION_POLISH.md).

## Previous checkpoint — visual equipment inventory

The author's CRPG equipment direction is implemented on the combined
`astra/equipment-update` candidate under live GDD LOD-UI-008. A left body map and
right icon grid support compatible drag/drop and click-to-equip, paired gloves,
weapon selection and consumable stacks. Owner snapshots preserve the window and
active drag; stale requests cannot remove a replacement item. All 74 integrated
automated suites pass; Source visual acceptance remains pending.
See [equipment inventory checkpoint](EQUIPMENT_INVENTORY_UI.md).

## Previous checkpoint — reactive character status portrait

The author's Doom-inspired HUD direction is implemented on the same combined
`astra/equipment-update` candidate. The live GDD LOD-UI-007 records the local HUD's
character-name-only exception, shared Character Sheet face, status replacement and
reactive expressions; tab 07 records cosmetic timing/layout choices.
See [portrait checkpoint](STATUS_PORTRAIT_CHECKPOINT.md) for implementation and the
finite visual gate. This preserves the equipment, enemy, wallet and Wizard changes
below. All 73 integrated automated suites pass; Source visual acceptance is pending.

## Previous checkpoint — persistent $DEB / DFT economy and Wizard balance

Shael accepted all [proposed wallet/DFT defaults](DEB_DFT_PROPOSAL.md) on 2026-09-15
and requested completion. The live GDD now records LOD-ECON-001 and the Wizard
changes in normalized tabs 02/03/06 and their HUMAN counterparts.

The combined `astra/equipment-update` candidate contains server-local transactional
wallets, rescue contribution allocation, persistent lifetime score, once-per-server
Combat Level 1/5/10/20 DFTs, rare drops, eight-slot collections and pending milestones,
and free once-per-token-per-run recreation or permanent sale at the staging statue.
Wizards gain one distinct starting Content; Summon is Wizard-only with base cost 12.
See [current evidence and finite runtime gate](CRYPTO_CHECKPOINT.md).
All 72 integrated automated suites pass. Source multiplayer/restart acceptance
remains pending; do not equate automated checks with a live-server acceptance.

The same candidate preserves the equipment, perk, enemy, recurring-staging, Hermit
and leaderboard changes for one combined playtest. The low-end/distant-player
[performance checkpoint](PERFORMANCE_CHECKPOINT.md) also remains intact: equipment
snapshot coalescing/deltas, retained pickup layouts and unchanged-stat caching.
Source FPS/RAM and real-network performance acceptance remain pending.

## Next scope

Shael's Equipment handoff explicitly promotes Equipment implementation ahead of
public deployment. Work is isolated on `astra/equipment-update`; main remains the
accepted RPG baseline. Workshop and public VPS are held until Equipment and Enemy
are both complete, followed by separately authorized deployment.

Shael's 2026-09-15 direction expands the approved first equipment catalog into a
unified procedural weapon/wearable economy and explicitly authorizes its missing
formulas. Live GDD LOD-EQUIP-016 owns the new 60-property catalog, budget/rarity
curves, active-weapon contributions, statuses and acquisition behavior. Earlier
LOD-EQUIP-015 Block, Throwable and Special Move semantics remain in force.
See [economy rules and handoff](PROCEDURAL_ITEM_ECONOMY.md) and
[checkpoint](EQUIPMENT_CHECKPOINT.md). Equipment runtime acceptance remains pending. The later explicit user direction
authorizes Enemy development alongside the Equipment playtest; main promotion
still requires appropriate runtime acceptance.

The subsequent 2026-09-15 completion assessment found and repaired a real
Equipment blocker: full procedural pickup records exceeded the engine's
NW2String limit, breaking comparison data. Owner-checked inspection messages now
carry the complete record, with production server/client transport tests; all
66 integrated suites pass. See [completion assessment](EQUIPMENT_ASSESSMENT.md).
The subsequent user direction explicitly supersedes the conditional Enemy hold.
Equipment and Enemy can now be tested together on the same development branch.

Preserve accepted RPG behavior and the current workflow. Do not restart the old
hybrid/Antigravity process. The broader Instruction Booklet reconciliation and
outstanding RPG multiplayer release validation remain required before deployment.

## Combined Equipment / Enemy checkpoint

Shael explicitly requested Enemy variety while testing Equipment. The first
combined checkpoint adds the Sniper graph-retreat/crossbow controller, Sniper and
Blitzer variants of eligible Firing Line encounters, and repairs the unified
spawner's missing Blitzer entry. Existing equipment and perk changes are retained.
See [Enemy update checkpoint](ENEMY_UPDATE.md) for the finite playtest and remaining
scope. All 67 integrated suites pass; this is a development-branch candidate,
not in-game acceptance or completion of the full Enemy milestone.

Continue the missing canonical enemies and final hunt/boss/timer work. The live
GDD leaves required attack tuning unresolved for Flamer, Big Crab, Razor and Arc
Caster; do not fabricate those numbers. Sniper tuning is explicitly delegated and
is recorded in tab 07. Authored Climber behavior and the remaining explicitly
specified work can continue independently of those gaps.

## History

The subsequent user-requested [identity perk correction](PERK_UPDATE.md) is a
bounded detour on the same Equipment development branch. Independent category
rolls and duplicate stacking are retained and explicitly tested; new ability
perks support +2 or +1/+1, and every visible title/flavor follows the resolved
mechanics. Existing Heroes keep their permanent rolls. All 66 integrated suites
pass; Equipment runtime acceptance remains pending.

The [pre-promotion plan](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_HISTORICAL_2026_09_14.md) preserves earlier
checkpoint sequencing and candidate handoffs. It is historical evidence, not the
current task queue. [Development status](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) records promotion
and validation. The live GDD remains design authority.
