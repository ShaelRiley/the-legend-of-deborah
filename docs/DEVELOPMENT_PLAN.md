# Current development plan

`main` is the canonical development baseline. Shael explicitly approved candidate
`87920e5ba3b27d46ff096f5a85cd41030a77f964` for promotion on 2026-09-14;
that exact commit was fast-forwarded to remote `main` without code changes.

Astra / Work is the primary implementation and senior-engineering environment.
Sol complements it with architecture, review, planning, and bounded implementation
where useful. Antigravity and `hybrid/antigravity` are retired as active development
workers/workflows. See [Development workflow](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md).

## Current checkpoint — low-end and distant-player performance

Shael's latest direction prioritizes low-end CPU/memory use and laggy connections.
The combined `astra/equipment-update` candidate now coalesces equipment snapshots
through the existing 100 ms presentation window, suppresses identical snapshots,
and sends changed/removed records after a full baseline. Gameplay effects stay
immediate. Pickup comparisons retain one layout; unchanged equipment skips repeated
stat aggregation. See [performance evidence and runtime gate](PERFORMANCE_CHECKPOINT.md).
All 69 automated suites pass; Source FPS/RAM and real-network acceptance remain pending.
This technical checkpoint does not settle the outstanding $DEB/DFT proposal defaults.

## Current author priority — persistent $DEB / DFT economy

Shael identifies the fake-crypto update as essential Equipment scope. His new
$DEB and item-backed Debbie Fund Tokens supersede the older six-currency,
cosmetic-DFT specification. This is now ahead of further Enemy expansion.
See [the concrete implementation proposal](DEB_DFT_PROPOSAL.md): account persistence,
contribution-sensitive rewards with a share for every cooperative participant,
once-per-server 1/5/10/20 milestones, eight DFT slots, very rare drops, statue-based
once-per-run recreation and sale. The missing allocation/drop defaults and level
interpretation are explicitly proposed there for an author decision; no wallet or
DFT implementation is claimed by the accompanying staging checkpoint.

The same checkpoint fixes actual recurring-staging omissions: reset deployment
before every next-maze build, issue one sealed repeat Hermit gift without another
firearm, and align the larger HEROES OF LEGEND board beside the mirror. Preserve
the existing combined Equipment/Enemy candidate and test these together.

## Next scope

Shael's Equipment handoff explicitly promotes Equipment implementation ahead of
public deployment. Work is isolated on `astra/equipment-update`; main remains the
accepted RPG baseline. Workshop and public VPS are held until Equipment and Enemy
are both complete, followed by separately authorized deployment.

Shael's 2026-09-15 direction expands the approved first equipment catalog into a
unified procedural weapon/wearable economy and explicitly authorizes its missing
formulas. Live GDD LOD-EQUIP-016 owns the new 60-property catalog, budget/rarity
curves, active-weapon contributions, statuses and acquisition behavior. Earlier
LOD-EQUIP-015 Block, Throwable and Special Move semantics remain in force.
See [economy rules and handoff](PROCEDURAL_ITEM_ECONOMY.md) and
[checkpoint](EQUIPMENT_CHECKPOINT.md). Equipment runtime acceptance remains pending. The later explicit user direction
authorizes Enemy development alongside the Equipment playtest; main promotion
still requires appropriate runtime acceptance.

The subsequent 2026-09-15 completion assessment found and repaired a real
Equipment blocker: full procedural pickup records exceeded the engine's
NW2String limit, breaking comparison data. Owner-checked inspection messages now
carry the complete record, with production server/client transport tests; all
66 integrated suites pass. See [completion assessment](EQUIPMENT_ASSESSMENT.md).
The subsequent user direction explicitly supersedes the conditional Enemy hold.
Equipment and Enemy can now be tested together on the same development branch.

Preserve accepted RPG behavior and the current workflow. Do not restart the old
hybrid/Antigravity process. The broader Instruction Booklet reconciliation and
outstanding RPG multiplayer release validation remain required before deployment.

## Combined Equipment / Enemy checkpoint

Shael explicitly requested Enemy variety while testing Equipment. The first
combined checkpoint adds the Sniper graph-retreat/crossbow controller, Sniper and
Blitzer variants of eligible Firing Line encounters, and repairs the unified
spawner's missing Blitzer entry. Existing equipment and perk changes are retained.
See [Enemy update checkpoint](ENEMY_UPDATE.md) for the finite playtest and remaining
scope. All 67 integrated suites pass; this is a development-branch candidate,
not in-game acceptance or completion of the full Enemy milestone.

Continue the missing canonical enemies and final hunt/boss/timer work. The live
GDD leaves required attack tuning unresolved for Flamer, Big Crab, Razor and Arc
Caster; do not fabricate those numbers. Sniper tuning is explicitly delegated and
is recorded in tab 07. Authored Climber behavior and the remaining explicitly
specified work can continue independently of those gaps.

## History

The subsequent user-requested [identity perk correction](PERK_UPDATE.md) is a
bounded detour on the same Equipment development branch. Independent category
rolls and duplicate stacking are retained and explicitly tested; new ability
perks support +2 or +1/+1, and every visible title/flavor follows the resolved
mechanics. Existing Heroes keep their permanent rolls. All 66 integrated suites
pass; Equipment runtime acceptance remains pending.

The [pre-promotion plan](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_HISTORICAL_2026_09_14.md) preserves earlier
checkpoint sequencing and candidate handoffs. It is historical evidence, not the
current task queue. [Development status](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) records promotion
and validation. The live GDD remains design authority.
